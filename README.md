**Quick Element** is an Web based card game inspired by ~~Dominoes and Uno~~ Crossword. The core theme of the game is about forming chemical bonds between different elements.

## Objective
The goal is to teach players about chemical bonding through a fun and accessible game format. By borrowing mechanics from popular games like **Uno** and **Dominoes**, itâ€™s a perfect fit for players of all ages and backgrounds.

## Gameplay
* Quick Element is a 2-player, turn-based card game.
* Each player starts with a hand of 5 cards and one random card on the board.
* On each turn, a player must place a card to form a chemical bond with an existing element on the board.
* If a player cannot place a card, they must draw one card and their turn ends. If the drawn card can be placed, they can play it immediately.
* When the board is completely filled and no more bonds can be formed, the game clears the board and a new random starting card is drawn.
